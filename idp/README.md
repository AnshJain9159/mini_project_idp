# 🩺 Interpretable AI: Diabetes Predictor

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on their clinical data. Its core feature is interpretability: it doesn't just provide a prediction, it explains why the prediction was made using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

The project is built with a standard Python data science stack and includes a simple, interactive web application created with Streamlit.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The "black box" nature of many advanced machine learning models is a significant barrier to their adoption in critical fields like healthcare. Clinicians need to trust a model's output and understand the reasoning behind it. This project addresses that challenge by building a highly accurate predictor for diabetes that can explain its predictions on both a global (all patients) and local (individual patient) level.

## ✨ Features

- **End-to-End ML Pipeline**: Scripts to train, evaluate, and interpret the model from start to finish.
- **High-Performance Model**: Uses XGBoost, a state-of-the-art algorithm for tabular data.
- **Model Interpretability**: Integrates the SHAP library to generate clear, visual explanations for every prediction.
- **Interactive Web App**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit where users can input patient data and instantly receive an explained prediction.
- **Reproducible Environment**: A requirements.txt file ensures a consistent and easy setup process.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and loading.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing, splitting, and model evaluation.
- **XGBoost**: The machine learning algorithm used for classification.
- **SHAP**: For explaining the model's predictions.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations like the confusion matrix.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository (or create your project folder)

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required libraries from the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Place the Dataset

Ensure that the diabetes.csv dataset is placed inside the `data/` directory.

## ⚙️ Usage

There are two main ways to use this project: running the full training pipeline or launching the interactive web app.

### 1. Running the Full Training Pipeline

To train the model, evaluate its performance, and generate the interpretation plots from scratch, run the main.py script from the root directory.

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This command will:
- Train a new XGBoost model and save it in the `models/` folder.
- Evaluate the model and print a classification report to the console.
- Save a confusion matrix and a global SHAP summary plot in the `visualizations/` folder.

### 2. Launching the Interactive Web App

To use the pre-trained model in an interactive interface, run the Streamlit app.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser. You can use the sliders and input fields on the sidebar to enter a patient's data and click "Predict" to see the result and its SHAP explanation.

## 📊 Results & Interpretation

After running the pipeline, you will get several outputs that help you understand the model.

### Model Performance

The evaluation script will print a Classification Report and save a Confusion Matrix. This tells you how accurate the model is at predicting both diabetic and non-diabetic cases.

### Model Interpretation

The key feature of this project is explaining the model's predictions.

#### Global Interpretation

The `global_summary_plot.png` shows which features are most important across the entire dataset. Features at the top have the biggest impact on the model's predictions.

#### Local Interpretation (in the Web App)

The SHAP force plot in the Streamlit app explains a single prediction.
- **Red features** (like BMI) push the prediction towards "Diabetic".
- **Blue features** (like Glucose) push the prediction towards "Not Diabetic".
- The final prediction is the result of these competing forces.
